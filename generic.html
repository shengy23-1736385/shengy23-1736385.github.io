								<h2 style="font-family:Perpetua">The Cat Who Adopted Bunnies</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; font-size:17px;color:chocolate">This is a true story about a lovely gray and white female cat, Missy, who gave birth to two sickly kittens. Sadly, within a very short time, both newborns died. It was heartbreaking to hear Missy crying and calling for her babies as she searched the house for her kittens. Missy was an indoor/outdoor cat who liked to hunt in a nearby field. Like many female cats, she liked to bring us her catch, and it wasn’t unusual for her offerings to include mice, birds or chipmunks, sometimes still alive and kicking!</p>
								<h2 style="font-family:Perpetua">The neglectful owner</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; font-size:17px;color:chocolate">My cat always hides her kittens very well. But if I’m not in a hurry to give her food, she brings them to me one by one and sits looking me in the eye, as if saying, “I’m a mother, and you don’t give me food! Shame on you!</p>
								<h2 style="font-family:Perpetua">The Cat Who Came for Thanksgiving</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; font-size:17px;color:chocolate">Our house and garage seemed to attract strange cats. They would find the cat door in our basement, enter and hide there, terrorizing our own cats. One November, a shy tiger cat became a regular, sneaking up the basement stairs to help himself to the cat food on our basement stair landing, but scooting away if we tried to lure him closer. One night we saw him in the basement covered in oil that he must have gotten into in our neighbor’s repair shop.</p>
								<h2 style="font-family:Perpetua">Bathing a Stray Cat Is No Fun!</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; font-size:17px;color:chocolate">Knowing that the oil or whatever he had gotten into would not come off by itself, we cornered the cat in our basement and wrapped him in old t-shirts while we gave him a bath – no easy task, let me tell you! Because he was soaking wet and sickly looking, we locked him in our bathroom with food, water and a litter box for a few hours until he dried off. Try as we might, we could not get him to trust us, and ended up letting him go back down into our basement where he found his way back out into the cold November night again.</p>
								<h2 style="font-family:Perpetua">Brave House Cat Trees Black Bear in New Jersey</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; font-size:17px;color:chocolate">In June of 2006, Jack, a 15 lb. declawed cat, protected his territory from a black bear by chasing it up a tree when the bear wandered into his yard in Milford, New Jersey. After about 15 minutes, the bear came down and tried to escape only to be chased once again by a hissing and spitting mad Jack who treed the bear once again. Finally, the owner took pity on the poor bear and called her watch cat indoors so the bear could be on its way.</p>
								<h2 style="font-family:Perpetua">Holly, the Cat, Travels 190 Miles Home</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; font-size:17px;color:chocolate">There are many stories of cats who have managed to travel long distances to return to their homes. Recently, a little tortoise shell cat named Holly was lost in Datona Beach, Florida. She managed to navigate almost 200 miles and showed up two months later near her home in West Palm Beach, Florida. Although the cat was half starved, weak, and had very sore paws from walking on concrete, an implanted microchip confirmed that it was indeed the missing Holly.</p>
								<h2 style="font-family:Perpetua">Copycat</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; font-size:17px;color:chocolate">Cats are weird, OK, but this… I get up before my husband, and our cat sleepily follows me to the bathroom, where his toilet is. Here we sit together, and then I realize he’s simulating! He’s just pretending to do his business! Probably repeating after me. Why in the world would he? Only he knows.</p>
								<h2 style="font-family:Perpetua">The favorite hole</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; font-size:17px;color:chocolate">We have a separate bath and toilet, but there’s a hole in the wall between them, under the bath. Not long ago, we took in a kitten, and he developed this habit of wriggling through that hole and into the toilet! He’s still afraid of water in the sink or the bath, but the toilet is his favorite place. Now he’s grown up and doesn’t fit in the hole anymore. So he goes to the kitchen, kicks over his water bowl, and plunges right into the spill.</p>
								<h2 style="font-family:Perpetua">Sneaky, evil queen</h2>
								<p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS; font-size:17px;color:chocolate">My tabby cat’s been trying to get rid of our tomcat since time immemorial. Her latest attempt was when I was having my dinner in the kitchen with the cats sitting beside me. I had to leave the room for a while, and after a few minutes, my kitty ran to me howling and calling me back. So I came and saw the tom eating away from my plate, which was lying on the floor. I started scolding the tom and thanking my kitty for her vigilance, but then I found out it was she who tipped the plate in the first place and then ran after me. How do I know? My boyfriend was sitting there and laughing.</p>
